#About This Website

My story
--

I've been working in web development for three full years now. To some that's a short time but to me it feels long. I've learned *so* much in that time and I can't even remember what it was like not to be obsessed with web development. In this time I have worked freelance, in a small shop, and in a big corporation as a web designer and developer. Three years ago my son had just been born and I had just quit my IT job with the intent to follow my dreams of becoming a web designer. I didn't know how to code but I designed websites in Photoshop and I was decent at it. I found [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com){:target="_blank"} and took their courses on CSS. I instantly fell in love with itâ€”and everything related to web development. 

I remember thinking that perhaps I was too late to the party and that everyone was so far ahead of me that I wouldn't stand a chance in the real world. Of course that wasn't the case, I would shortly find out two things. I found that there was actually a shortage of web developers that specialized in CSS. Many developers dislike CSS and weren't interested in learning it beyond the basics. It makes sense because most developers function on a whole 'nother level than, say, designers. They like logical problem solving and critical thinking and don't necessarily care about layouting and typography. 

The other thing I found was that by entering the world of web development as late as 2012 I had missed most of the chaos, the browser wars, the hacks and the legacy support. I had entered a much more grown up, mature and magical era of web development. For that I am thankful.

Worst client ever

The core reason I made this website was that I wanted to try to design for myself; see what complete artistic freedom would look like. I also wanted to try out the latest shiny toys in web development that I hadn't had the chance to try out yet, like Jekyll and libsass, and it was fun... At first. 

I kept getting bored of my designs and must have trashed the project at least three times thinking it was awful. Not having a client or a project manager to see the project with fresh eyes and tell me their thoughts was harder than I had anticipated. I am by far my worst client to date. I made the mistake to keep working on the project until when I felt the fatique coming, instead of  taking a break for a day or two but that's how I am. Once I set my mind on something I can't possibly take a break from it until I get some closure. It's kind of awful, I should work on that.
