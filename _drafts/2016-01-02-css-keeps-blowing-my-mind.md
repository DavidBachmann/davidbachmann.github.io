#CSS Keeps Blowing My Mind

Backstory
--

I've been working with CSS for three full years now. To some that's a short time but to me it feels long. I've learned so, *so* much in that time and I can't even remember what it was like not being obsessed with web development. In this time I have worked freelance, in a small shop, and in a big corporation as a web designer and developer. Three years ago my son had just been born and I had just quit my IT job with the intent to follow my dreams of becoming a web designer. I didn't know how to code but I designed websites in Photoshop and I was decent at it. I found [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com){:target="_blank"} and took their courses on CSS. I instantly fell in love with it--and everything related to web development. I remember thinking that perhaps I was too late to the party and that everyone was so far ahead of me that I wouldn't stand a chance in the real world. But, of course that wasn't the case. I would shortly find out two things:

I found that there was actually a good market for web developers that specialized in CSS, because they were rare. The reason was that most developers disliked CSS and would only learn the basics because they had to. It made sense, though, because most developers work on a whole 'nother level than, say, designers. They like logical problem solving and critical thinking. They do not like floating elements left and right or care if the list style marker was a disc or a square.

The other thing I found was that by entering the world of web development as late as 2012 I had missed most of the chaos, the browser wars, the hacks and the legacy support--and entered a much more grown up, mature and magical era of web development which consisted of pre-processors, task runners and compatible browsers.
I want to thank you nerd warriors out there that fought these fights and made our profession that much more enjoyable.

The gift that keeps on giving
