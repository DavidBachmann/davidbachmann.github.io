Don't Forget Yourself
===

For the longest time I have wanted to dedicate some time to make this website but I have always postponed it. I have had an underlying desire to make something that reflected myself as a web designer and that showcased who I am and what I'm about.
I wanted to try out some of the new and shiny development toys that I hadn't gotten around to. I wanted to try out this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"} thing I had been hearing so many good things about. But overall I wanted to see what the outcome of total creative freedom would look like—and I'm glad I did.

If I had to guess I'd say that only 20 percent of web designers and developers have their own websites and only a handful of those actively maintain it. Not because they don't want to but because it's so easy to forget yourself when you have a lot of projects on your hands, maybe a family at home to spend time with, and too little free time. I totally understand that.

That Creative Urge
---

Most of us are creative individuals and get that *creative urge* when we get inspired. On the Internet it's hard not to get inspired *all the time*. Just watching your Twitter feed and seeing those nice shots on dribbble, that technical demo on Codepen, or that amazing website on Awwwards.
What's bad is not fulfilling this urge and making something for yourself solely for the reason that you want to. It will eventually result in feeling burned-out and unfulfilled. At least that's how I was starting to feel.

What I wanted to say is this: Don't postpone that personal project any longer. Take the loss of a few hours "wasted". Make yourself some coffee (if that's your thing), crack your knuckles and *get on it*! When you do it you'll feel amazing—and that's what this is about.
