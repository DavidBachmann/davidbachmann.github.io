My story
--

I've been working in web development for three full years now. To some that's a short time but to me it feels long. I've learned *so* much in that time and I can't even remember what it was like not to be obsessed with web development. In this time I have worked freelance, in a small shop, and in a big corporation as a web designer and developer. Three years ago my son had just been born and I had just quit my IT job with the intent to follow my dreams of becoming a web designer. I didn't know how to code but I designed websites in Photoshop and I was decent at it. I found [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com){:target="_blank"} and took their courses on CSS. I instantly fell in love with itâ€”and everything related to web development. 

I remember thinking that perhaps I was too late to the party and that everyone was so far ahead of me that I wouldn't stand a chance in the real world. Of course that wasn't the case, I would shortly find out two things; I found that there was actually a market for web developers that specialized in CSS. Many developers dislike CSS and weren't interested in learning it beyond the basics. It made sense because most developers function on a whole 'nother level than, say, designers. They like logical problem solving and critical thinking. They do not like floating elements left and right or care if the list style marker should be a disc or square.

The other thing I found was that by entering the world of web development as late as 2012 I had missed most of the chaos, the browser wars, the hacks and the legacy support. I had entered a much more grown up, mature and magical era of web development which consisted of pre-processors, task runners and JavaScript on the server.
I want to thank you nerd warriors out there who fought these fights and made our profession that much more enjoyable.
